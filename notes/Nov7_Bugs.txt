==============BUGS================

✓ G.TownSelected is getting reset to 0 when clicking on the Mrkt Grid while Mrkt Demand is not visible.
✓ The Bank has improper text rendering in the Panel objects.

✓ Sometimes, in the MapScreen the RightLabel objects do not pop out when they are supposed to. 
	(The issue was with obj_GameState.hasTriggered somehow being set to `true` prematurely. It is now
	set to `false` in the Room Creation Code for rm_MapScreen)

✓ The "SET SAIL" button is still functioning even while not visible.

✓ On the 2nd journey from a Port, the obj_tracer object still spawns at VAIO.

✓ Sailed to Zandretta. Did some shopping. When I came back to map screen, I was in Syrr? 
  obj_Player was placed on Syrr, but obj_Tracer was in Zandretta.

✓ Can't exit the Kanda Bank, or the Barcellus Bank.

✓ In Barcellus, walked into Pub, teleported to Vaios. Walked out to the Map screen. Exited Map screen. Back in Barcellus.

✓ In Kanda, walked into Store, teleported to Vaios. Walked to Mapscreen, exited mapscreen, back in Kanda.
	✓ Same results with Kanda Bank.
	✓ Same results with Kanda Pub.

✓ In Chirsk, walked into Pub, teleported to Vaios. Walked out to the Map screen. Exited map screen. Back in Chirsk.

✓ I sailed to Zandretta, then Syrr, then Kanda. When I went into the Kanda store, my barrels read
  "555 out of 999" barrels.
	✓ (I later went to Chirsk, same number.)
	✓ (I went to VAIOS next but the numbers were correct.)

✓ Passengers are not disembarking the ship.
	✓? I don't think the End Turn passengers aboard number is correct on the 2nd+ voyage.
	✓? The Board Passengers button doesn't seem to work properly on the 2nd+ voyage.

• I tried to click on Set Sail when heading for Syrr on 2nd voyage (from Zand), but nothing happened.
	• From Kanda to Syrr -- Works.
	• From Zand to Domos -- Doesn't Work (worked after reset).
