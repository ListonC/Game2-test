=============STARTING A TURN==============

• Add a "PayOwed" attribute to ds_map for each crew member.
• Add a "Morale"attribute to ds_map for each crew member.
• Removed "CrewQuitChance" from crew ds_map and Captain objects.

• Simplify Captain Pros and Cons
	• 1 Crew Pro
	• 1 Crew Con
	• 1 Ship Pro
	• 1 Ship Con

• Ships don't get Pros and Cons, only different stats.


==============CREW MORALE=====================

A single crew member starts their Morale at 100. When this individual sails on the boat
the morale is effected in the following outcomes (tentative figures):

• Nothing happens. -10 Morale
• A bad random event happens (unrelated to crew actions). -15 Morale
• Witnessing a crew member be punished for causing a bad event. -18 Morale
• Witnessing a captain show mercy. +5 Morale
• Being punished. -50 Morale
• A good random event happens (unrelated to crew actions). +5 Morale
• A good random event the crew is responsible for. +10 Morale
• Winning a battle. +15 Morale
• Losing a battle. -30 Morale
• Getting paid. +20 Morale
• Getting paid... but not the full amount. -15 Morale

The number cannot exceed 100 or go below 0. If a crew member's morale is 0 by the time they
reach the End Turn screen, the crew member quits.

================QUITTING========================

When a crew member quits, they automatically deduct their individual Pay Owed from Cash. If there
is not enough in Cash, they deduct from Savings until satisfied. If there is not enough in Savings,
they increase the Bank Loan until satisfied. If the Bank Loan credit limit is exceeded in this manner,
the game is over.

==============RANDOM EVENTS=====================

When visiting the MapScreen, some of the tiles are given a Random Event. If the Player collides with
that tile (after having pressed Set Sail), a Random Event occurs. These Random Events sometimes have
pre-determined outcomes that are good or bad. Other times, they require a choice from the Player that
then determines if the outcome is good, bad, or neither. Once the ship reaches the Destination, the
End Turn room begins. Any Morale Bonuses / Deductions must be applied *before* going to the End Turn
room.


=============LUCK SYSTEM======================

When a Random Event occurs, the Captain rolls a D100 + Luck Modifier. If the roll is low, like say less
than 40, then the game randomly selects from the Bad Events table. The roll is somewhere in the middle range,
then a Neutral Chance Event is selected, and if the roll is high then a Good Event happens.

Most Captains have a Luck rating of 0. Some Captains might start out with a Luck rating of like 10, or -10.
Other special events/items/transactions can have an effect on a captain's luck rating (temporary).

============RANDOM EVENTS=====================

What kind of effects could a Random Event have?
