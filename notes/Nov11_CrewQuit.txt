=============STARTING A TURN==============

• Add a "PayOwed" attribute to ds_map for each crew member.
• Add a "Morale"attribute to ds_map for each crew member.
• Removed "CrewQuitChance" from crew ds_map and Captain objects.

• Simplify Captain Pros and Cons
	• 1 Crew Pro
	• 1 Crew Con
	• 1 Ship Pro
	• 1 Ship Con

• Ships don't get Pros and Cons, only different stats.


==============CREW MORALE=====================

A single crew member starts their Morale at 100. When this individual sails on the boat
the morale is effected in the following outcomes (tentative figures):

• Nothing happens. -10 Morale
• A bad random event happens (unrelated to crew actions). -15 Morale
• Witnessing a crew member be punished for causing a bad event. -18 Morale
• Witnessing a captain show mercy. +5 Morale
• Being punished. -50 Morale
• A good random event happens (unrelated to crew actions). +5 Morale
• A good random event the crew is responsible for. +10 Morale
• Winning a battle. +15 Morale
• Losing a battle. -30 Morale
• Getting paid. +20 Morale
• Getting paid... but not the full amount. -15 Morale

The number cannot exceed 100 or go below 0. If a crew member's morale is 0 by the time they
reach the End Turn screen, the crew member quits.

================QUITTING========================

When a crew member quits, they automatically deduct their individual Pay Owed from Cash. If there
is not enough in Cash, they deduct from Savings until satisfied. If there is not enough in Savings,
they increase the Bank Loan until satisfied. If the Bank Loan credit limit is exceeded in this manner,
the game is over.
