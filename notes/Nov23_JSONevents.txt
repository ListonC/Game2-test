=======RANDOM EVENTS ORDER OF OPERATIONS==============

• Player clicks SET SAIL
• Player boat rolls Random Chance for number of tiles travelled.
	• As soon as Player rolls a Success on Random Chance,
		• The iterator number is the number of tiles travelled before reaching that point,
		so you must warp/stop the player boat at that tile once it collides at that tile.
		• Pull tile id from list of tiles, when Player Collides with that tile, stop path
		movement.
	• Mark hasEvent = true
• hasEvent = true
	• Player rolls their Luck number d100 and adds their Captain luck modifier.
		• If  the roll is between 0 to 33, a Bad Event is picked
		• If the roll is between 34 to 66, a Neutral Event is picked
		• If  the roll is between 67 and 100, a Good Event is picked
			• When a Bad Event is rolled, there are a few more internal rolls that happen
			• The game rolls a 1-26 irandom, slot1 (for example, let's say a 6 is rolled)
			• Then another 1-26 roll happens, slot2 (let's say a 4 is rolled)
			•  6 = F, 4 = D. In other words the numbers correspond to the alphabet
			• It's time to pull the event from the JSON file
				• Because it's a BAD event, the first character is 'B'
				• the second character is slot1, or 'F'
				• the third character is slot2, or 'D'
				• Open and read as ds_map the JSON file.
				• Create a new instance of Random Event Card, using the variables associated
				with id: "BFD"
					• Open and Read JSON file
					• Create ds_map
					• Fill ds_map with variables that correspond to BFD in the JSON file
						• QUESTION? Is this possible? Can the JSON file be searched?
					• Note: If the lookup "BFD" doesn't exist, have it change to a "default" lookup
					instead, like "BAA"
				• Instance Create obj_RandomCard, fill with BFD values.
• obj_RandomCard
	• Has 0 / null values for variables necessary to a random event.
	• When created, given the variables pulled by the Player Boat
	• Pops up from bottom of screen.
		• By default, has an "OKAY" acknowledgement button. 
		• If "isDecision" is true, then the "OKAY" button is replaced with "YES" or "NO"
		• Clicking either of those buttons pops down the the Random Event Card
			• Have effects take place
			• Destroy Card
			• If Yes/No decision, spawn resulting card with value-lookup from yesGoto or noGoto
			
• Go to End Turn room.
